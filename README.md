To cause a sermon to be recorded during normal worship times add the appropriate 'cateogry' to your presentation. The 'category' needs to have within
it the words, 'sermon' or 'class'.  You can find the 'cateogry' property of the
presentation by going to File in Powerpoint and looking at the right side where
properties of the presentation are listed.  If your cateogry contains sermon or
class then when you start a presentation during a worship time, a separate
screen recorder will also be started.
